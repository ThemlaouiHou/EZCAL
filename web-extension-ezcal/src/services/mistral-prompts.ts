`STEP 1: READ AND UNDERSTAND
Read the entire content carefully. Identify the main topic/event.
IMPORTANT: Analyze the page context to determine the current date reference. Look for:
- Published dates, timestamps, or "today is..." mentions
- Relative terms like "tomorrow", "next week", "in 3 days", "this Friday"
- Calculate absolute dates from relative references using the context

STEP 2: DISTINGUISH EVENT TYPES
- MAIN EVENTS: Actual events people attend (conferences, meetings, competitions, performances)
- SUPPORT DATES: Registration deadlines, submission dates, administrative deadlines
- Focus ONLY on MAIN EVENTS, ignore support dates

STEP 3: EXTRACT MAIN EVENTS ONLY
Return ONLY a code block with one event per line, pipe-delimited format:
title | start | end | location | allDay

RULES:
- Extract MAIN EVENTS only, not administrative dates
- Date formats: YYYY-MM-DD (no time) or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (with time)
- Convert relative dates to absolute dates using context clues from the page
- If NO specific time mentioned: treat as all-day event (allDay: true)
- For point-in-time events (deadlines): use same date for start and end
- For online meetings/events: use "Online" as location
- allDay: true (no time/all-day), false (specific time given)
- No extra commentary outside code block
- Be really Carefull about the date and specially the year
